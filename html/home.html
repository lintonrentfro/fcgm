        <p>
            Fate Core is a great RPG system because the game/setting creation gets all of the players
            contributing.  The downside to this game creation process is that it requires all the players
            to get together and hash it all out.  For whatever reason, a lot of players are resistant
            to doing this.
        </p>
        <p>
            While a lot of players won't have a "game creation meeting", they will banter endlessly about
            a potential game setting over food, while waiting in line for a movie, or in the car.  Why?
            Because it's more fun! That's where the Fate Core Game Manager comes in handy.  Players can
            help create the game any time and from any device with a web browser.

    <div class="row-fluid">
        <b>Create a Game or Character</b></br>
        <p>
            In the application menu, click Games->Create Game or Characters->Create Character. The newly created game
            or character will then appear under Games->My Games or Characters->My Characters.
        </p>
        <p class="text-warning">
            You have to be logged in to use this application, but you don't need to verify your account.
            Just create an account and start using the application immediately.

    <div class="row-fluid">
        <b>Join a Game</b></br>
        <p>
            To join a game, you need the game's secret password, which is found by viewing the game and
            scrolling to the bottom of the page. In the application menu, click Games->Share or Delete Game.
            Give that code to the people who want to play with.  They can paste the game's secret password
            into the popup box when they go to Games->Join Game. If the code matches an existing game, the
            game will now be listed under Games->My Games.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="row-fluid">
        <b>Edit a Game</b></br>
        <p>
            All players who have access to a game can all edit the game in real time.  To edit part of the game,
            just click/touch that part of the Game Creation Worksheet.  Clicking the text of a field won't
            let you edit it (so you can select/copy that text if needed).  You must click on the box to edit
            that field.
        </p>
        <p class="text-error">
            All players have full access to a game. The assumption is that if you don't trust someone
            well enough not to maliciously delete the game or mess it up, then you wouldn't want to
            play a Fate Core game with them!
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="row-fluid">
        <b>Edit a Character</b></br>
        <p>
            To edit part of the character, just click/touch that part of the Character Worksheet. The sheet
            will re-draw itself immediately which will scroll back to the top of the sheet if the entire
            sheet did not fit vertically in your browser window.
        </p>

    <div class="row-fluid">
        <b>Delete a Character</b></br>

            To delete a character, go to Characters->Manage.

            For now, printing out the Worksheets is the only option. They are scalable vector graphics,
            so you can print them to any size and they will always be sharp and clear.
